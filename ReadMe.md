## NextGen (Next Generation) ##

NextGen is a non-profit establishment for helping the youth connect with eachother and develop their artistic skills and find their inner artist - most notably the Live Open Stage jams.
- The live music performance allows children to play popular songs (from modern and classic bands) to play on any instrument of their choosing: guitar, bass, drums, sing.  unlike traditional music education where it is focused on classical and theory techniques, this gives them the outlet and chance to perform like a modern day artist.  
- there will also be other thingsl like visual arts, and graphic design opportunities and events-
