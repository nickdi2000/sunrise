- always build robust, clean, defensive code with proper error handling
- the UI should be clean, modern and high contrast like Uber, (dark black primary buttons, outlined secondary)
- always show blank states (like a list with no data)
- when navigating into details of something (like a list of records to a specific record), always add a back button
- put things into their own components if they are complex enough to justify it, and break it up by responsibility making it agostic to parent components when possible. 
- show error/success messages on the page inline (dismissable) after any kind of form submission (POST/PUT etc)
